What I was working on 
1) CRUD Functionality for Description
    - create : just finsihed
    - read : just finished
    - update : just finished
        -working on live updae for place holder
    - delete : Just finished


Overall TODO list

2) Need To add log in

3) Need to fix live redux update issue for create lead && description
    - create lead doesnt return the array properly
    - create description returns an empty array block

5) Possibly add serializations

6) Format dates to MM/DD/YYYY 00:00:00
    - Error with Split

7) add dates to front end

8) need to switch read lead from functional to class component
